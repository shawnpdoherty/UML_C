Week 8 (Pointers) Lecture Note Files

This folder contains a set of subfolders that will provide the files needed 
to compile and build various pointer examples in Week 8 using multiple
files.   If needed, it converted examples in the lecture notes to 
separate each function into its own file and provide a Makefile to 
build the program executable.  You can also copy and paste each C
Source and C Header file into your compiler IDE and compile/build your
program that way.

The subfolders are shown below, and you should be able to follow
along with the corresponding lecture note in Week 8.

1) Array of Pointers (Pines)
2) Pointer Test
3) Pointers (Array of Structures)
4) Pointers (Structures in Functions)
